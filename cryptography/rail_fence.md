Put the decoded message in the picoCTF flag format, `picoCTF{decoded_message}`.

## Solution

You *should* do it on paper manually and figure out the flag with that, and that's far more fun. But I've used an [online decoder](https://www.dcode.fr/rail-fence-cipher) for convenience, I used 4 as the rail count and got `The flag is: WH3R3_D035_7H3_F3NC3_8361N_4ND_3ND_83F6D8D7`
