## Solution

Enter a wrong username and password (or just manually go to `/login.php`) and use inspect element, you'll see a `secure.js `file, right click it and press `Reveal in sources panel`, it'll show you the source code of the file which is

```javascript
function checkPassword(username, password)
{
  if( username === 'admin' && password === 'strongPassword098765' )
  {
    return true;
  }
  else
  {
    return false;
  }
}
```
Enter `admin` as the username and `strongPassword098765` as the password. And your flag is ready!
