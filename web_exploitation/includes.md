<summary>Hint 1</summary>

Is there more code than what the inspector initially shows?

</details>

## Solution

Using inspect element, we can see that there's a script tag for the script.js file

Right clicking on `script.js` and pressing `Reveal in Sources Panel` will show you the code

Then you'll see the last part of the flag

So where's the first part? it's inside the `style.css` file. Click it from the sidebar

Now join the both parts and you have your flag!
