## Description

Can you get the flag?
Here's the [website](http://saturn.picoctf.net:56978).
We know that the website files live in `/usr/share/nginx/html/ `and the flag is at `/flag.txt` but the website is filtering absolute file paths. Can you get past the filter to read the flag?

## Hints

(None)

## Solution

Enter `../../../../flag.txt` to get the flag
