## Description

The program provided allows you to write to a file and read what you wrote from it. Try playing around with it and see if you can break it!
Connect to the program with netcat:

    $ nc saturn.picoctf.net 50366

The program's source code with the flag redacted can be downloaded [here](https://artifacts.picoctf.net/c/538/program-redacted.c).

## Solution

You can write some data to a "database", read the data, and exit the program. To get the flag you need to first press 1 to enter a phrase to the database, then you can enter any data you want (I wrote `hello`), and then it'll ask you for the length of the data, (for me it's `5`). Then it'll ask you if you want to do anything else, to get the flag, type `2` to read a phrase and then enter a negative number or a character, it'll give you the flag
